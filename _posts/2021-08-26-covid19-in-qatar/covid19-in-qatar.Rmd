# Data Description

The data is sourced from the **tidycovid19** R package created by **Joachim Gassen** on [Github](https://github.com/joachim-gassen/tidycovid19), which in turn sourced the data from **The Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE)** publicly available [Github repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). JHU CSSE collated the numbers from the responsible body of each country.

The data contains the following variables:

|**variable**      |**class** |**description** |
|:-----------------|:---------|:-----------|
|country           |character |Country name |
|iso3c             |character | ISO3c country code as defined by ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 |
|date              |date      | Calendar date |
|daily_confirmed   |numeric   | Daily increase in Covid-19 cases |
|acc_confirmed     |numeric   | Accumulated Covid-19 cases |
|daily_deaths      |numeric   | Daily increase in Covid-19 deaths |
|acc_deaths        |numeric   | Accumulated Covid-19 deaths |
|daily_recovered   |numeric   | Daily increase in Covid-19 recoveries |
|acc_recovered     |numeric   | Accumulated Covid-19 recoveries |


# Summary Statistics

```{r}

label(qatar_1$daily_confirmed) <- "Daily Confirmed Cases"
label(qatar_1$acc_confirmed) <- "Accumulated Confirmed Cases"
label(qatar_1$daily_deaths) <- "Daily Deaths"
label(qatar_1$acc_deaths) <- "Accumulated Deaths"
label(qatar_1$daily_recovered) <- "Daily Recovered"
label(qatar_1$acc_recovered) <- "Accumulated Recovered"

my.render.cont <- function(x) {
    with(stats.apply.rounding(stats.default(x), round.median.min.max = FALSE), c("",
        "Mean (SD)" = glue("{MEAN} ({SD})"),
        "Median [Min, Max]" = glue("{MEDIAN} [{MIN}, {MAX}]")))
}
  
table1(~daily_confirmed + acc_confirmed + daily_deaths + acc_deaths + daily_recovered + acc_recovered,
       data = qatar_1,
       render.continuous=my.render.cont,
       topclass="Rtable1-grid Rtable1-shade Rtable1-times",
       caption = "Summary statistics of COVID19 in Qatar. The accumulated death rate at 601 is extremely low compared to the number of accumulated cases at 227,000")
```
<br>

What can be noticed from the table is the extremely low number of total deaths at `r max(qatar_1$acc_deaths)` from a total of `r format(plyr::round_any(max(qatar_1$acc_confirmed), 1000, ceiling), scientific = FALSE, big.mark = ",")` cases, representing a death rate of only **`r round(max(qatar_1$acc_deaths)/plyr::round_any(max(qatar_1$acc_confirmed), 1000, ceiling) * 100, 2)`%**, which is extremely low compared to the global average of 2% (World Health Organisation [WHO], 2021). Several factors contributed to this figure. One of which is that Qatar has a relatively low median age at 32.3 years (Worldometer, 2021). Additionally, a fine of up to $53,000 has been instated for anyone who does not wear a face covering in public, and as per a Qatari official "anyone who tests positive for coronavirus immediately receives high-quality medical treatment at no cost" (Tadros, 2020).


# Daily Figures

```{r, layout="l-body-outset"}
datatable(qatar_1, 
          options = list(pageLength = 5),
          rownames = FALSE,
          colnames = c("Date", "Daily Confirmed Cases", "Accumulated Confirmed Cases", "Daily Deaths", "Accumulated Deaths", "Daily Recovered", "Accumulated Recovered"),
          caption = "Daily COVID19 Figures in Qatar",
          filter = 'top')
```
